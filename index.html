                <p> A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits are divisible by 3.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 1. Consider the number 64725.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Sum of its digits= (6+4+7+2+5) = 24, which is divisible by 3.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Therefore, 64275 is divisible by 3.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    EXAMPLE 2. Consider the number 39583.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Sum of its digits= (3+9+5+8+3) = 28, which is not divisible by 3.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Therefore, 39583 is not divisible by 3.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A number is divisible by 5 if its ones digit is 0 or 5.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 1. Each of the numbers 65, 195, 230, 310 are divisible by 5.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 2. None of the numbers 71, 83, 94, 106, 327 148, 279 is divisible by 5.

                    TEST OF DIVISIBILITY BY 7: 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A number is divisible by 7 if the difference between twice the one digit and the number formed by the other digits is either 0 or a multiple by 7.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 1. Consider the number 6804. Clearly, (680- 2 Multiplied by 4) = 672, which is divisible by7. Therefore, 6804 is divisible by 7.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 2. Consider the number 137. Clearly, 2 Multiplied by 7)-13=1, which is not divisible by 7.
                    Therefore, 137 is not divisible by 7.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 3. Consider the number 1367.
                    Clearly, 136- (2 Multiplied by 7) = 136-14 = 122, which is not divisible by 7.
                    Therefore, 1367 is not divisible by 7.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 1. Consider the number 65403. Sum of the digits= (6+5+4+0+3) = 18, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, 65403 is divisible by 9.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A number is divisible by 11 if the difference of the sum of its digits in odd places and the sum of its digits in even places (starting from the ones place) is either 0 or a multiple of 11.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 1. Consider the number 90728.

                    Sum of its digits in odd places = (8+7+9) = 24.
                    Sum of its digits in even places = (2+0) = 2 Difference of the two sums = (24-2) = 22, which is clearly divisible by
                    11. Therefore, 90728 is divisible by 11.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EXAMPLE 2. Consider the number 863423.Sum of its digits in odd places = (3+4+6) = 13.Sum of its digits in even places = (2+3+8) = 13. Difference of these sums = (13-13) = 0. Therefore, 863423 is
                    divisible by 11. EXAMPLE 3. Consider the number 76844. Sum of its digits in odd places = (4+8+7) = 19. Sum of its digits in even places = (4+6) = 10. Difference of these sums = (19-10) = 9, which is not divisible by 11.Therefore, 76844 is not divisible by 11.
